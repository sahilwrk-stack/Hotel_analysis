🍽️ Smart Multi-Location Restaurant Sales & Analytics System
📌 Project Overview

This project is a web-based restaurant management and analytics system designed to handle and analyze orders from multiple locations (Delhi and Himachal). The system allows users to select a branch, place food orders (Half/Full), and automatically generate structured CSV data for sales tracking and performance analysis.

It bridges operational management with data analytics by enabling location-wise comparison, revenue tracking, and downloadable datasets for further analysis.
